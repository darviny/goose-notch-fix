QUICK START GUIDE
=================

Fix Unity's -popupwindow keyboard focus issue in 3 steps:

STEP 1: Build the dylib
------------------------
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh

STEP 2: Test it
---------------
chmod +x test.sh
./test.sh

STEP 3: Launch your Unity app
------------------------------
chmod +x launch.sh
./launch.sh /path/to/YourUnityApp.app -popupwindow

Example:
./launch.sh ~/Desktop/MyGame.app -popupwindow

VERIFY IT WORKS
---------------
1. Open Console.app
2. Filter by your app name
3. Look for these messages:
   [WindowFix] Injecting canBecomeKeyWindow/canBecomeMainWindow fix
   [WindowFix] Swizzled canBecomeKeyWindow
   [WindowFix] Swizzled canBecomeMainWindow

4. Try typing in the popup window - it should now work!
